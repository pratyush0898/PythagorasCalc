# PythagorasCalc

A simple Pythagorean theorem calculator implemented in Python.

### How to Use:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pratyush0898/PythagorasCalc.git
   ```

3. Run the Python script.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   **Note:** If you encounter an error related to Python or the math module, make sure both are installed. You can install the math module separately if needed.

   ```bash
   pip install math
   ```

4. Input the height and base of the triangle when prompted.

5. Get the calculated hypotenuse instantly.

### Example:

```plaintext
Enter the height of the triangle: 3
Enter the base of the triangle: 4

The Hypotenuse of Pythagorean theorem is 5.0
```
